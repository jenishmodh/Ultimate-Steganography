## Ultimate Steganography software:superhero:

The do all steganography application.:grin:<br>

- Images
- Audio
- Text

>This is an important application especially in today's world.<br>
> We need hide the messages rather than only encrypting them.

## Features

- Hide your private messages in images, audio & text files.
- Forgot password in case you forget. <br>
(Click on the _3 dots_ in main window to know more)
- Access info about any button just by hovering on it.

---



Using those those _3 dots_ present in topright of the above window, user can create an account in case they forget the password for their repective hidden messages in files.



## Other Notes

All modules are standard modules of **batteries included** python. Then use the `main.py`.
**Having `Cascadia Code` font makes the GUI look best.**
Rest the GUI is quite explanatory so hope you don't have any problem using this.
In audio steganography only `.wav` files are supported presently. In images are formats are supported.

## Roadmap

- Enabling encryption of data

- Add more video support

## Steganography is not Cryptography ! :confused

If you are getting confused between _Steganography_ & _Cryptography_. Then see this -

#### Cryptography

**If** `you = wms` **then** `Qcaapgrw gq gknmprylr` **= ?**<br>
_Can you guess the answer?_<br>
Here we have `key = -2` i.e. if we go 2 alphabets behind `y` you get
`w` and similarly if you go 2 alphabets behind `o` we get `m` and similarly 2 alphabets behind `u` gives us `s`. Therefore `you = wms`. <br>
So now you may have got the answer which is `Security is important`.
> Note: The cryptography algorithms are much advanced now.
